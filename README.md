## Introduction

This repository serves as my personal learning journal for Python. As I work through the book, I will be committing my solutions to exercises, challenges, and projects. The goal is to reinforce my understanding of Python fundamentals and best practices.

## Setup

To work with this repository locally, you’ll need to have Python installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-crash-course.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the directory:
   ```bash
   cd python-crash-course
   ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Install required packages (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once set up, you can run any of the Python files in the repository. For example, to run `hello.py`, use:
```bash
python hello.py
```

Each project will be stored in its own folder. I’ll follow the structure outlined in the book, organizing my code by chapters and topics.

## Project List

- **Chapter 1:** Introduction to Python
- **Chapter 2:** Variables and Data Types
- **Chapter 3:** Control Flow
- **Chapter 4:** Functions
- **Chapter 5:** Classes
- **Chapter 6:** Projects

More projects will be added as I progress through the book.
